      <p>Apollo Aperture is a desktop application that analyzes Apollo and React code and displays the relationships
        among React components and Apollo queries and/or subscriptions. This tool provides developers with critical
        insight into their frontend architecture so that they can minimize unnecessary component re-rendering and
        optimize their application. In a coming update, it will also enable a developer to invoke mutations and see how
        queries are affected.</p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>Apollo Client is designed so that a developer can insert GraphQL mutations, queries, and subscriptions almost
        anywhere in their code and connect them to React components. In a large codebase, however, this can become
        problematic because developers can find themselves in connected component hell where queries and mutations are
        strewn across their codebase and React components are connected with multiple queries and mutations. Not only is
        this an issue for developers, it can also cause issues for users. When Apollo’s client store or cache is
        updated,
        React child components which rely on queries or subscriptions are re-rendered, causing React’s DOM diffing
        algorithm to do more work which increases loading time on the client.</p>
